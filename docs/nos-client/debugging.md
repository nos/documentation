Since the nOS Client `v0.3.0` the new developer console for debugging has been added. Previously you were only able to log one parameter, and you were not able to watch the network traffic, react/redux console etc.. These days are over!

#### Using developer tools inside the nOS Client
When you've navigated to your dApp (usally at location `http://localhost:1234`) or when you have any other web page open, you can now **right click** and select `Inspect element` to view your elements, console, networks, etc..
