More features are coming to the nOS API in the near future. The nOS team plans to work closely with
dApp developers to ensure that any interactions that will ease development are exposed through the
API.


## Current Features
---
### Client API
When browsing with the nOS client, the client exposes a set a functions to interact with the NEO
Blockchain.

### Events API
When browsing with the nOS client, the client exposes a set of events for being notified about
network and blockchain changes.

### `nos://` protocol
If your dApp links to a target with an `nos://` protocol, the nOS client will treat it as a dApp
request.  This can open another dApp, or it can open another page related to the current dApp.
More details forthcoming.

### `getNetwork` API Function
The nOS API will expose a function for fetching the current network (e.g.: "MainNet").

### `network` Event
